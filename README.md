# Gas_Station_Sim

- To run download the GasStationSim.jar file
- Either just click to run
- Or you can run from the command line using: java -jar GasStationSim.jar
- If you use the command line it will give you extra info pertaining to the max volume of your vehicle, volume of petrol already in your vehicle and how much petrol is in the reservoir

# How it works

- On launch you will get info on your current vehicle (Car, Bie, Lorry or Van) + the fuel it takes
- Simply hold down the "Fill" button to start the filling process
- The dispensed volume and the cost will continually update as the Filling happens
- You can end the sale at any time by clicking the "Finish" button
- Sale must be minimum of Â£1.00 to end
- Filling will also end if your vehicle is full or Reservoir is empty
- Once you click Finish it will create a new Vehicle and you can start the process again
- The reservoir will continually deplete across all the filling operations
